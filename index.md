Hello! My name is Qiong Cao (pronounced as /chiong/ /tsau/; Chinese: 曹琼). I'm a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT, co-advised by [Dr. Josh Tenenbaum](https://cocosci.mit.edu/josh) and [Dr. Shari Liu](https://pbs.jhu.edu/directory/shari-liu/). Previously, I was a PhD student at Johns Hopkins University, working
with [Dr. Lisa Feigenson](https://pbs.jhu.edu/directory/lisa-feigenson/). Before that, I
earned my MA in Psychology at New York University and my BS in Psychology from Zhejiang University, China.

I'm interested in the representations and computations that underpin reasoning and learning, with a particular interest in information-seeking in early childhood. My work spans different age groups and topics, with key questions such as: "How do children and adults respond to prediction errors?", "What information do children use to build and update causal beliefs?", and "Which factors help children decide what to learn and what not to learn?" Currently, I'm exploring adults and infants' surprise responses after observing physical violations. During my PhD, I studied how infants and young children reason about and learn from surprising objects, agents, and everyday events. You can read more about [my research here](./research/).

In my free time, I enjoy going to concerts, watching clouds and flowers, browsing Trader Joe's snack aisle with friends, and adoring cute animals—especially [my lovely cat](./assets/images/yurek.jpg).
